 *  Purpose:                          *
 *   A website that contains several  *
 *   algorithms for different user    *
 *   purposes. For example, the 4     *
 *   voice harmony algorithm will     *
 *   take the user's input of a       *
 *   scale and a starting scale       *
 *   degree. The program will then    *
 *   create a triad from the user's   *
 *   info and follow the rules of     *
 *   writing triads in 4 voices       *
 *   harmony.                         *
 *                                    *
 *  Known Issue:                      *
 *   Resizing the window tab          *
 *   doesn't work for the             *
 *   drawn staves. This may be caused *
 *   by since it is not a prexisting  *
 *   element on the screen and instead*
 *   is being drawn onto the screen.  *
 *                                    *
